# The-Fiduciary-Breach-of-the-Modern-University
A groundbreaking study in fiduciary-epistemic theory that reimagines the modern university as a constitutional guardian of knowledge. It exposes how marketisation and managerialism erode truth, compares universities to hybrid AI firms, and proposes legal reform to restore candour, accountability, and public trust in knowledge.
