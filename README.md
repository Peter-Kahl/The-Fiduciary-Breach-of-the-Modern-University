## Abstract

This paper consolidates the fiduciary–epistemic theory of institutional authority by diagnosing the modern university as a constitutional actor suffering systemic fiduciary breach. Drawing upon Redefining Democracy for the Age of AI (Kahl 2025), Epistemic Gatekeepers as the Fourth Estate (Kahl 2025o), and Epistemic Clientelism Theory (Kahl 2025), it contends that universities, historically conceived as fiduciaries of knowledge and trustees of public reason, now function as hybrid entities whose loyalties are divided between epistemic truth and market survival. Through this inversion, the university ceases to be a fiduciary institution and becomes an agent of epistemic capture.

Integrating insights from When the Higher Education System Flashes Red and Higher Education as Critical Infrastructure, the paper argues that higher education constitutes part of the epistemic constitution—its Fourth Estate—and therefore bears duties of candour, care, impartiality, and accessibility to the public. Yet under conditions of managerialism, branding, and bureaucratic opacity, these duties collapse into performative compliance. The resulting pathology—epistemic clientelism—replaces trust with dependency, candour with spin, and scholarship with algorithmic obedience.

To restore legitimacy, the paper proposes the Epistemic Fiduciary University (EFU): an institutional model embedding fiduciary duties of candour and care as enforceable legal and moral standards, complemented by independent epistemic audits and public beneficiary rights. The EFU, positioned as the epistemic counterpart to Kahl’s Epistemic Fiduciary Entity (EFE), reconstitutes the university as the Fourth Estate of democracy—an autonomous guardian of epistemic welfare within the constitutional architecture of knowledge.
