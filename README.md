## Abstract

This paper develops a fiduciary–constitutional theory of knowledge by diagnosing the modern university as a core organ of the epistemic estate undergoing systemic fiduciary breach. Building on _Redefining Democracy for the Age of AI_ (Kahl 2025k), _Epistemic Gatekeepers as the Fourth Estate_ (Kahl 2025l) and _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ (Kahl 2025h), the study argues that universities—historically conceived as trustees of public reason—have been transformed into hybrid entities divided between epistemic duty and market survival. Through this inversion, universities cease to function as fiduciaries of knowledge and instead become agents of epistemic capture.

The analysis proceeds across macro-institutional, micro-psychological, and constitutional levels. Chapter 3 examines the structural breaches produced by managerial opacity, network capture and branding-based optocracy. Chapter 4 extends the argument into epistemic psychology, using the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) alongside Friston’s predictive-coding and Carhart-Harris’s entropic-brain models to show how fiduciary breach conditions cognition: dissonance is suppressed, plurality narrows, and anticipatory obedience becomes a psychological norm. Chapter 5 reconstructs the constitutional consequences of this process, tracing the evolution of peer-review cartels, media–consultancy complexes, and algorithmic gatekeeping into an epistemic market state in which credibility is brokered rather than deliberated.

Chapter 6 proposes juridical and institutional reforms through the _Epistemic Fiduciary University_ (EFU) and the _Fiduciary Commission for Knowledge Integrity_, embedding fiduciary duties of candour, care, loyalty and accessibility as enforceable standards across the epistemic estate. Chapter 7 advances the philosophical foundations of this framework. Drawing on Arendt’s conception of a shared world of appearance and Habermas’s account of communicative legitimacy, it presents re-commoning as a constitutional remedy: a reconstruction of the epistemic commons in which knowledge is restored as a public trust rather than a proprietary good.

The paper concludes that fiduciary law, epistemic virtue and institutional openness together constitute democracy’s moral infrastructure. The survival of an open society depends upon preserving a fiduciary order of knowing—an epistemic constitution in which the openness of thought and the openness of governance stand or fall together.
