## Abstract

This paper consolidates the fiduciary–epistemic theory of institutional authority by diagnosing the modern university as a constitutional actor suffering systemic fiduciary breach. Drawing upon _Redefining Democracy for the Age of AI_ (Kahl 2025 k), _Epistemic Gatekeepers as the Fourth Estate_ (Kahl 2025 l), and _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ (Kahl 2025 h), it contends that universities—historically conceived as fiduciaries of knowledge and trustees of public reason—have been transformed into hybrid entities whose loyalties are divided between epistemic truth and market survival. Through this inversion, the university ceases to be a fiduciary institution and becomes an agent of epistemic capture.

Integrating insights from _When the Higher Education System Flashes Red_ (Kahl 2025 n) and _Higher Education as Critical Infrastructure_ (Kahl 2025 o), the paper redefines higher education as part of the epistemic constitution—its _Fourth Estate_—bearing fiduciary duties of candour, care, loyalty, and accessibility to the epistemic public. Under regimes of managerialism, branding, and bureaucratic opacity, these duties collapse into performative compliance. The resulting pathology—epistemic clientelism—substitutes trust with dependency, candour with optics, and scholarship with algorithmic conformity.

To restore legitimacy, the paper proposes the **Epistemic Fiduciary University (EFU)**: an institutional model embedding fiduciary duties of candour, care, loyalty, and accessibility as enforceable legal and moral standards. The EFU incorporates independent epistemic audits and public beneficiary rights, aligning domestic reform with UNESCO and OECD integrity frameworks. Positioned as the epistemic analogue to Kahl’s _Epistemic Fiduciary Entity_ (EFE), the EFU reconstitutes the university as a core organ of the _Fourth Estate_—an autonomous guardian of epistemic welfare within the fiduciary constitution of knowledge.  The paper concludes that fiduciary law, epistemic virtue, and institutional openness together form democracy’s moral infrastructure, and that the restoration of the fiduciary compact of knowledge is essential for the survival of an open society.
